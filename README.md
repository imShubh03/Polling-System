# Live Polling System

A real-time polling application designed for teachers and students, built with React, Redux, Express.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB. This system allows teachers to create polls, view live results, and manage students, while students can submit answers and view results. The application uses environment variables for configuration and includes a chat feature for interaction.

## Features

### Must-Haves
- Functional polling system with teacher and student personas.
- Teachers can create polls and view live results.
- Students can submit answers and view poll results.
- Real-time updates powered by Socket.io.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas) running.
- Internet connection for dependencies.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-polling-system.git
cd live-polling-system
```

## 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following:

```
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/polling_system
# For MongoDB Atlas:
# MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/polling_system?retryWrites=true&w=majority
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

**Server:**

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

**Client:**

```bash
cd ../client
